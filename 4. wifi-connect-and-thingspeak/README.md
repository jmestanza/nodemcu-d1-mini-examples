# Connect to WiFi and use Thingspeak

In this example we will see which networks our device can be connected to. In my case, I've noticed that the ESP8266 can't connect to a 5.8GHz type of network, so in this tutorial we will see if the network we are attempting to connect is available or not.

You can try running the following code to see the available networks (with the Serial Monitor opened).

```c
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <WiFiClient.h>
#include <ESP8266HTTPClient.h>

#define WIFI_SSID "NAME_OF_WIFI_NETWORK"
#define WIFI_PASS "PASSWORD_OF_WIFI_NETWORK"

void scan_wifi_networks(){
  Serial.println("Scanning available networks...");
  int numSsid = WiFi.scanNetworks();
    for (int thisNet = 0; thisNet < numSsid; thisNet++) {
    Serial.print(String(thisNet) + ") " + WiFi.SSID(thisNet)+ "\n");
  }
}

void connect_to_wifi(String WifiSsid, String WifiPass){

// Begin WiFi
  WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);
// Connecting to WiFi...
  Serial.print("Connecting to " + String(WIFI_SSID) + "\n");

// Loop continuously while WiFi is not connected
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)
  {
    delay(5000);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  // Connected to WiFi
  Serial.println();
  Serial.print("Connected! IP address: ");
  Serial.print(WiFi.localIP());
  Serial.println();
}


void setup() {
// Setup serial port
  Serial.begin(115200);

  scan_wifi_networks();

// Uncomment this line once you know you've checked that WIFI_SSID appears on the look up
//  connect_to_wifi(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PASS);

}

void loop() {
}
```

Once you've run it you can change the following section of the code

```c
#define WIFI_SSID "NAME_OF_WIFI_NETWORK"
#define WIFI_PASS "PASSWORD_OF_WIFI_NETWORK"
```

In order to connect the board to your WiFi network.

If all the steps went well you should see the message "Connected! IP address: ... " in the Serial Monitor ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰.
